Dminishing marginal utility: Eeach additional unit of consumption brings about less benefit than the unit before it.

The biggest lie in personal finace is that you can be rich if you just cut your spending.

The most consistent way to get rich is to grow your income and invest in income-producing assets.

The main porint is to tighten up where you can, then focus on increasing your income.

Sell your time/expertise: Doesn't scale. Can't get extremely wealthy.

Sell a skill/service: Doesn't scale easily.

Teach prople: Easily scalable. Lots of competition.

Sell a product: Scalable. Upfront investment and constant marketing.

Corporate ladder: Gain skills and experience. Can't control your time or what you do.

All of the methods above should be viewed as temporary measures, because your extra income should be used to acquire more income-producing assets.

The end goal should be ownership. You need to convert your human capital into financial capital to build long-term wealth.
