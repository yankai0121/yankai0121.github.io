## ⚡ 4. Rules for Success

1.  **Batch Cook Lunch:** Cook your rice/pasta and meat for 2 days at a time. Store the second portion in the fridge. This ensures you never skip a meal because you are "too tired to cook."
2.  **Drink Your Calories:** If you struggle to finish a meal, rely on the liquids (Milk and Shake). It is physically easier to drink 200 calories than to chew them.
3.  **Gym Timing:**
    * Eat **Lunch** 2–3 hours *before* training.
    * Have the **Shake** or **Dinner** *immediately after* training.
