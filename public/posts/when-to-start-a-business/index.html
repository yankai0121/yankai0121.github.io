My favorite quote:
&ldquo;A man holding a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way&rdquo; -Mark Twain
You need to grab that tail and learn things you will not otherwise.
From that it follows that the answer to your question is: As early as possible.
This also means you probably should not make your first experiences the most grandiose ideas. You might actually want to assume failure. Don&rsquo;t assume you know anything about business at all. Jump in. Make mistakes. Learn. If you get lucky, great. If your experience is &#43;/- on standard deviation from the mean, you&rsquo;ll come out of the experience all cut-up and bloody (image: holding cat by tail). And you will also come out with tons of wisdom. That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t bet the farm on your first attempts. You are far more likely to fail. Don&rsquo;t worry. Keep going. Make small bets. Don&rsquo;t risk it all in one hand. Make small bets and learn.">
